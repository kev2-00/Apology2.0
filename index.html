      <h2>A Letter to Marie</h2>
      <article>
        <p>My dearest Marie,</p>
        <p>There are mistakes that echo louder than a heartbeat, and mine has been thundering for days. I hurt you, and
          in doing so I bruised the best part of my own soul. I am sorry—fully, fiercely, and without excuses.</p>
        <p>There are some mistakes that change us, that remind us of what truly matters. When I hurt you, I hurt myself
          too, because you've become the best part of my heart.

          I know words can't undo what happened, but I hope they can begin to heal. I've spent days replaying our
          argument, wishing I could take back what I said, how I acted. The look on your face stays with me—a reminder
          of how careless I was with someone so precious.

          I was wrong. I was defensive when I should have listened. I owe you an apology, one that is quieter and from
          the gentlest part of me
          I am truly sorry for speaking to your mom about us. It wasn't fair to you, our relationship was something
          sacred, something between you and I
          and I had no right to share piece of it without your blessings. No matter what my intentions were, I should
          have respected your wish, your privacy
          and your heart
          And even now as I type this, I am sorry again for bringing it up once more. I know this might open moments
          that was already hard enough, But if I could
          go back and undo it, I would, A thousand times over. I just did not want to leave wrong hanging in the air
          like an unfinished sentence between us.
          Please Marie.....If there's still a quiet corner in your heart where you can find a position to forgive me. I
          hope this finds its was there. I am not asking to
          rewrite the past. Just hoping to soften the edge of it. You deserve peace, love and respect even from my own
          mistakes. I'll keep on learning, growing
          and keep on loving you Marie. Thank you, even just for reading this.
          Your's absolute Love
        </p>
